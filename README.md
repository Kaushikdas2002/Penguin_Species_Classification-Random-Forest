# Penguin_Species_Classification-Random-Forest

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying penguins based on their species types using a Random Forest classifier. Penguin species classification is a valuable task in wildlife research and conservation. This project aims to develop a Random Forest model to predict the species of a penguin based on various features such as bill dimensions, flipper length, and body mass.

## Introduction
Penguin species classification is essential for understanding the behavior and characteristics of different penguin species. This project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to analyze and classify penguins into their respective species based on a set of physical measurements and attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains information on penguins, including species type, bill dimensions, flipper length, body mass, and other relevant features.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 94%  
Precision: 94%  
Recall: 94%  
F1 Score: 94%
